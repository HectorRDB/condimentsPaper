# condimentsPaper

This repository is made to host a reproducible version of the condiments paper. Some of the functions can take a long time to 
run and we have therefore saved intermediary objects. However, they can be entirely recreated by running all code blocks in the appropriate vignette. 

You can access a preprint of the paper here and the condiments package is available on github [here](https://github.com/HectorRDB/condiments).

You can follow along the vignettes [here](https://hectorrb.github.io/condimentsPaper/articles/).

There are 5 vignettes that follow along the paper

# Examples

The first vignette is a list of all examples used in Figure 1 of the manuscript


# Simulation

The second vignette contains the code to run all simulations. It is not run here but instead loads the data from this package to generate the plots from Figure 2,
Figure S1 and Figure S2. 


# TGFB case study

The third vignette contains all the code to download the first dataset. It then loads the dataset from this package and conducts the analysis to generate 
Figures 3 and 4.


# TCDD case study

The fourth vignette contains all the code to download the second dataset. It then loads the dataset from this package and conducts the analysis to generate 
Figures S3 and S4.

# KRAS case study

The fifth and final vignette contains all the code to download the third dataset. It then loads the dataset from this package and conducts the analysis to generate 
Figures 5, S5 and S6.
